# BSHSTV
This is an app I made for my school's television studio. I posted the app here primarily for resume and backup purposes. 

## Features
### Client App (iOS)
* View announcements, videos, polls, and other content added to the server
* Push notifications (WIP)
### Server (PHP & MySQL)
* Database Driven

## Project Structure
* The Clients/iOS folder is the source for the actual app
* The Server/2.0 folder contains the admin interface and API handlers for the iOS app
* The Licenses folder contains copies of the license files I obtained when obtaining several dependencies used in this project
* All the code in Clients/iOS/Pods is code from the app's dependencies and is not mine
* The .framework files in Clients/iOS are for Google Ads and are not mine
