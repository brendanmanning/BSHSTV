# Node.js server
This is the old server. It used to connect to the app through sockets, but that functionality was since removed for fetching JSON from a PHP server. I'm leaving it here just because.

# Requirements
* Node.js (and NPM)
* Socket.IO

# Important
Due to licensing issues, I cannot distribute expressjs with this source code. I would leave it up to the user to download that themselves. However, this is really not important because at the moment the softwares doesn't even run. Like I said, it's just legacy stuff.
