# BSHS TV Admin Interface and API
The BSHS TV app calls these scripts at certain URLs (apps.brendanmanning.com/bshstv/<api file name>.php?arguments=arg). Also, an easy to use web interface is also in the works

## Installation
I'll be working on a easy setup wizard to make sure URLs hardcoded into the app get replace with wherever you set this server up.

## Requirements
(Approximate)
* PHP 5+
* MySQL
(Tested on Namecheap Shared Web Hosting. Anything similar should be fine)
